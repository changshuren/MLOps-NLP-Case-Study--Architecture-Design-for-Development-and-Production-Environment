## General Information
Project background - Be Healthy,a healthtech company, provides a web-based platform for doctors to list their services and manage patient interactions. It provides various services for patients, such as booking interactions with doctors and ordering medicines online. BeHealthy would want to convert these free-text clinical notes to structured information for NLP analytics purposes and automate the existing manual process. An architecture diagram needs to be prepared that can highlight all data, model training and inference pipeline using cloud-based AWS Sagemaker.
